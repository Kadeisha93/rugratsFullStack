# rugratsFullStack

I created a fullstack web application based on the classic Nickelodeon show, Rugrats! Take the quiz to see which character you are.

## How It's Made

**Tech Used:** HTML, CSS, Javascript, Express, Node.js, Mongo DB

This website is a quiz that allows you to answer a few multiple choice questions and receive a result of a character. I made the basic functions of the site run on the client side javascript page. All other functions that process the results for the characters were used on the back end, using Express and Node.js. All results are held in a database, so if the person with the same credentials logs back in, they can see the previous results.

## Lessons Learned
Creating this really helped me understand playing around with the data base while digging more into the backend. I made a project similar to this before using only javascript, so it was great learning the differences and really seeing the power of the back end!

## Installation
1. Clone repo
2. run npm install

## Usage
1. run `node server.js`
2. Navigate to `localhost: 8080`
